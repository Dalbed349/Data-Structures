      Goal: 1.Make a request for 10 meeting list agenda pages Alcoholics annonymous NYC and save html body into txt files.
            2. Upload this file, javascript, and 10 txt files to github.
      
      
      
      Notes:- The task could have been completed with 10 individual request functions. 
            - Began by creating an array of 10 URLs for the websites.
            - Created a for loop i= the length of the URL array. 
            - Use function to write html body to txt file depending on position in array. 
            - Run for loop with this function inside to prevent asychronous js from causing issues. 
            
           
             -It was important to turn the request into a function in order to give for loop time to parse each instance of i. 
                    --->>Asychronous operations. Had to write function. 
             
             - When writing file name (map1.txt) it was important to use 
                iteration+1 since the loop starts at 0 when we want our txt files to start at 0     
                
        CURRENT WORK IN PROGRESS: 
              - Remove .c9 folder from github commits and pushes. How can I add this to a git ignore file?
